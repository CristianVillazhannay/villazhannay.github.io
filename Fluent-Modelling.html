							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>As an intitial foray into computational fluid dynamics, we wanted to create a working model of polypropylene flows into aluminium molds. The reason that this particular project was chosen is because it was being developed concurrently with the <a href="Injection-Molding.html" target="_blank">injection molded part</a>; therefore, we could use the physical parts as a form of validation of our simulation.
							</p>
							<p>
							More specifically, however, our simulation was aimed at optimizing the flow of the polymer within the mold itself. By analyzing this flow, we could identify potential mold design issues that would lead to problems like sinkage, weld lines, jetting, etc. 
							</p>

							<h2>Goal</h2>
							<p>To create a simulation of polypropylene flows in aluminium molds that accurately depicts polymer flow and direction, and to optimize mold design and polymer flow path. 
							</p>

							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>Some of the challenges that were encountered in this problem were wrestling with Fluent's ability to process interfaces with high viscosity differentials. This is especially relevant for injection molded plastic, where the zero-shear viscosity between the air and plastic differs by 7 orders of magnitude!
							</p>
							<p>Likewise, the physical properties of molten polypropylene are highly non-Newtonian, and implementation of an accurate shear-rate being reflected on the viscosity presented issue.</p>

							<p>However, in the face of all these challenges, the team was able to create a running VoF (Volume of Fluid) simulation of an idealized version of polypropylene into an aluminium mold. 
							</p>

							<h2>Conclusions</h2>
							<p>Seeing as I was in charge of investigating, creating, and modifying parameters within the actual Fluent software that would help us get the best possible results; I learned how to approach and begin modelling physical problems in CFD programs, through a deep understanding of the different parameters and their effects on the simulation behavior. This included analysis of solution convergence, residual error, and documention. 
							</p>

							<p>This project also served to reinforce my understanding of how engineers can affirm that the results they get are correct. This was manifested through the verification and validation process, where we first check that the correct equations are being solved, and then we confirm with physical or experimental data.  </p>

							<p>If this project were to be revisited, however, the team would employ better suited tools for these flows like Ansys Polyflow.</p>
