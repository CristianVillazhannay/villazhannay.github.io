							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>This injection molded part, a cartoon character called Kirby, was chosen because of the design challenge that the small and large geometry provided. This part was to be a 2 piece assembly, that would have an interference fit with another 2 piece assembly, a lollipop.</p>

							<h2>Goal</h2>
							<p>To create a replicable injection molded part, with a functioning assembly and interference fit. </p>

							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>As an individual, I was assigned with the complete development of the back half of Kirby. This included designing and dimensioning both a part and a mold, machining of the corresponding mold, and using the mold with the injection molding machine to create the part</p>

							<p>To address the reason why the the small and large geometry posed such a challenge was because there were restriction on the maching tools that were available to us. The deep cuts in between Kirby's feet and torso were simply not possible to machine with a 1/16" drill bit with an 1/8" depth. The visualization below emphasizes this problem in our CAM program, with an analysis of how true to our actual part we machined.</p>

									<div class="col-4"><p>The scale on the right shows the differential between the true part, and the mold that will be created. The blue rings emphasize where our part could not be reliably machined. We compromised and chose to keep a smooth surface finish instead of attempting to get closer. Some might say this warranted a redesign, but due to time constraints, we were forced to settle.</p></div>

									<div class="col-4"><p>This is the final part. Since this was a classroom setting, we wanted to be mindful of waste and reuse when possible. This explains why the color of the output parts are not solid, because we simply input whatever polypropylene was available - no matter the dye color. </p></div>

							<p>For those interested, the dimensions of the molds are included in the drawings, included in the report below. </p>


							<h2>Conclusions</h2>
							<p>In the process of completing this class, I gained a very thorough understanding of how to create and operate CAM programs, and how to optimize CAM design so that the output would have a smooth surface finish and be as quick as possible. This also included setup and best practice for monitoring CAM programs that are running</p>

							<p>A re-introduction to GD&T and its application helped me gain a newfound appreciation for the underlying complexity that is present in mating parts. This was especially pertinent with the polypropylene that we were using since it has shrinkage of about 1.8% that has to be accounted for</p>
